    * In the case of an incoming authentication request a POST is made
    with the following structure.

        POST /token HTTP/1.1
        Host: server.example.com
        Authorization: Basic czZCaGRSa3F0MzpnWDFmQmF0M2JW

    The basic auth header contains the client_id:client_secret base64
    encoded for client authentication.

    The username and password are form encoded as part of the body. This
    request *must* be made over https.

    The response to this request will be, assuming no error:

        HTTP/1.1 200 OK
        Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
        Cache-Control: no-store
        Pragma: no-cache

        Authorization: Basic czZCaGRSa3F0MzpnWDFmQmF0M2JW
        Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

        grant_type=refresh_token&refresh_token=tGzv3JOkF0XG5Qx2TlKWIA

    The response will be the same as above with a new access_token and
    refresh_token.
